/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All data is
 * considered private and is nested within a user-specific document tree. Access to any
 * piece of data is granted only to the authenticated user who owns that data tree.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically, starting with a top-level
 * `/users` collection. Each user's data, including their vehicles, fuel logs, and
 * maintenance alerts, is stored in subcollections under their unique document path
 * (e.g., /users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}/...). This structure ensures that
 * ownership is implicitly defined by the document's path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All operations (read, write, delete) are restricted to the
 *   user whose UID matches the {userId} in the path. There is no public or shared data.
 * - No User Listing: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is
 *   explicitly disallowed to prevent user data enumeration and protect privacy.
 * - Self-Creation: A user is permitted to create their own user document
 *   (e.g., /users/{auth.uid}) upon sign-up, but cannot create documents for others.
 * - Path-Based Security: The rules leverage the document path for authorization, which
 *   is highly performant as it avoids extra database reads (`get()` calls) to
 *   check for ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: This ruleset relies on path-based security, which
 * is a form of structural denormalization. Ownership is determined by the document's
 * location in the database, not just by a field inside the document. For subcollections,
 * relational integrity is enforced by validating that internal IDs (e.g., `userId` or
 * `vehicleId`) match the corresponding IDs in the path upon creation.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The entire data model is based on segregation. Each user's
 * data is completely isolated within its own document tree. This makes security simple,
 * performant, and prevents any possibility of data leakage between users.
